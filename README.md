This is a simple set of scripts in python which I had written to arrange my movies' filename and TV shows' episodes based on IMDB datasets.
I hope you find it useful.

https://datasets.imdbws.com/
2. Then import them into a database (e.g. I use MySQL)
2.1. Create database and tables
2.2. Import files into tables
